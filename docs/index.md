As geodesists that use the Bernese GNSS Software [BSW] for different campaign
types, we need a software system that automates the creation of campaigns,
downloads necessary data, configures and starts BSW's processing engine [BPE],
and, finally, assures the quality of and handles the end products that come out
of the BPE process.
